<center><h3>ˆ˜¨ We are a server hoping to spread, express, and show our beliefs! ˆ˜¨</h3></center>

ˆ˜¨ We are a 24/7 online church with 2 close sides of religion, Catholic and ˆ˜¨Christianity! Every Sunday we will have church, and go over bible ˆ˜¨teachings, which can help us especially in a time like this where we cannot go out and learn about Jesus in the real world due to Covid. ˆ˜¨

This can also be a place for those who want to learn more about Christianity and Jesus but would like to start off simple. We also welcome non-Christians that just want a non-toxic community to talk with. The Crimson Shepard's Church is a perfect place to do this! We are a friendly and helpful society based around Jesus' teachings. 

Some things we provide:
- Sin confessional channels where you can confess (Staff available if you want a private conversation)
- Channels for prayer/ bible study
- Channels for the history of Jesus 
- Places to talk with other Christians
- Fun bot commands 
- Weekly bible study/ church
